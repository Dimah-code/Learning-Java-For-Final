Why is Java considered platform-independent?

Java is considered platform-independent because Java programs are compiled into bytecode,
which is not specific to any one machine or operating system. This bytecode runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
and since the JVM is available for many different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.),
the same compiled Java program can run anywhere the JVM is installed.
This principle is often summed up as:

    "Write once, run anywhere."
